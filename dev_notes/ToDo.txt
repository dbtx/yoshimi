Direct access to envelope not updating Gui graph and freemde not correctly registering with Gui, but seems to work correctly otherwise.

Make NRPN midi learn able to be re-learned.

Sort out direct access dynfilter->filter (and two enclosed controls). All work but don't update gui.

LV2: internal sound banks do not appear to be exposed as LV2 presets

Find out why LV2 only stores/retrieves patch sets (not state)

Make add voice & add/pad oscillator windows show kit number & name.

Allow headless compilation.

Add ARM specific options to CmakeLists.txt

Add scales control to CLI.

Make things like LFOs either floats or much higher resolution.

Consider enabling and disabling tooltips.

Make attempt to start second independent instance open a new one in running yoshimi instead - saves memory and more consistent.


RPNs (channel based)

101,0 (MSB)

100,0 Pitch bend range
100,1 Fine detune
100,2 Coarse detune

Maybe a NRPN variation of this for global fine tuning.

Improve Copy & Paste functionality.
